# What is TREBL?

TREBL-seq is a method used to quantify activation domain strength and speed. By sequencing RNA barcodes in reporter transcripts, we can measure the strength of thousands of activation domains across multiple time points.

This package can be used to analyze the sequencing data from a TREBL-seq experiment and produce activity scores. A detailed breakdown of the analysis workflow is documented below. There are also example scripts in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/staller-lab/trebl_tools).
